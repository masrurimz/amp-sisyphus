# Sisyphus Notepads

This directory contains session notes from Sisyphus Junior executors.

## Purpose

When executing tasks, agents record:
- What they did
- Issues encountered
- Decisions made
- Questions for future sessions

## Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-[task-slug].md`

## Integration

These notes feed into `.sisyphus/wisdom.md` at session end.
